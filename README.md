<b>Random Walker</b>

Another school project. Used for searching the path that will have a length of more than 100 (or 1000). There is no user input, 
algorithm draws random numbers, and - based on the number (from 0 to 5) chooses the direction in a 3D space (x,y,z).
When the length from the start point to an end point (in a straight line) is beyond a certain value - the algorithm stops.
There is also a function in code that calculates total operating time of the algorithm.
After running, start position is displayed - such as the end position at the end.
